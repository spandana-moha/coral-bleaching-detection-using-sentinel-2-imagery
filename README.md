# coral-bleaching-detection-using-sentinel-2-imagery
This project detects and maps potential coral bleaching events using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE). It leverages unsupervised machine learning to classify pixels into "bleached-like" and "healthy" categories, providing a scalable method for monitoring coral reefs.
